7. Use NPM to download project dependencies.

* If you haven't already, [download NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). (NPM comes bundled with Node.js)

* Use the command `npm install` to install dependencies for the project

8. Set enviornment variables

* Create a file where the repository is located called `.env`. Inside of it, you will paste the keys that you found eariler.
    
    * Set `AIRTABLE_BASE` to your Base ID, and `AIRTABLE_KEY` to your API Key.
    * Set `LOGGING` to `on` if you want to enable logging, `off` if otherwise. We reccomend you set this to `on`.
    * Set `BOT_LOGGING` to `on` if you want to enable logging for crawlers, `off` if otherwise. We reccomend you set this to `on`.
    * Set `CACHE_EXPIRATION` to the number of seconds you want the local cache to be valid. For our links, we should aim for under 2 minutes so that we can make fast changes during club meetings.

    Here is what a sample `.env` file might look like:
    ```
    AIRTABLE_BASE=#################
    AIRTABLE_KEY=#################
    LOGGING=yes
    BOT_LOGGING=yes
    CACHE_EXPIRATION=120
    ```

    **WARNING: Never share this file with anyone, or commit it back to the repository.**

9. Now for the fun part! Use the command `node app.js` to run the program! If you want to stop it, use the shortcut CTRL+C.

TODO: Figure out how to get the rest working ðŸ˜‰
